<br>The dataset consist of sales of previous 1941 days sales of 3049 items in 10 stores of 3 states in US. Apart from historical sales data we also have rate of each item at corresponding store and dates information like events on that corresponding date.</br>

<br>A customized metric known as WRMSSE based on MAPE is used as performance metric. 

<br>Performed 4 models on the dataset (Simpel Exponential Smoothing, XGBoostRegressor, CatBoostRegressor, LGBMRegressor).</br>

[EDA_FE.ipynb](https://github.com/Deshram/M5_accuracy/blob/main/EDA_FE.ipynb): Performed preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset and introduced lags and rolling features. Converted time series problem to supervised machine learning problem.<br/>

[ses.ipynb](https://github.com/Deshram/M5_accuracy/blob/main/ses.ipynb): Performed simple Exponential smoothing.<br/>

[models.ipynb](https://github.com/Deshram/M5_accuracy/blob/main/models.ipynb): Performed all three above mentioned bossting algorithms.<br/>

[final.ipynb](https://github.com/Deshram/M5_accuracy/blob/main/final.ipynb): Final deployment model.<br/>

Choosed CatBoostRegressor for final model.

Out of 5558 participants the ranks for score 0.685 were in range of 490-500's i.e the score can be considered under top 10% percentile rank.
